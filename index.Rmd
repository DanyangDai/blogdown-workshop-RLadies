Before we start, can we do a quick survey about your experience with R. Please put your hand up if you worked with blogdown before. Have you worked with R markdown before? Have you worked with R before?  


Great! now that I have an basic idea about your experience now. Let's get started!

# Let's begin our journey  

Copy this lines of code to your RStudio Console:


```{r,echo=TRUE,message=FALSE,eval = FALSE}
library(blogdown)
new_site(theme = "wowchemy/starter-academic")
```

## Serve site 

```{r,echo=TRUE,message=FALSE,eval = FALSE}
blogdown::serve_site()
```

## Stop serving site 

```{r,echo=TRUE,message=FALSE,eval = FALSE}
blogdown::stop_server()
```

### Blogdown automatic serve site everytime you make a change and saved it. So no need to serve site everytime
